# Dotfiles for my Linux systems.

Use the branches to switch between system dotfiles.

Currently primarily using EndeavourOS with GNOME 42.

Other system is Arch Linux with i3. 

Really just depends on whether I am looking for a desktop experience or a more productive WM experience. My preference changes from time to time so I have both systems installed.
